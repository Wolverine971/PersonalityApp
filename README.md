# PersonalityApp

This the goal of this project is to use personality data to increase awareness and self-improvement of individuals. 
Ultimately I want to foster community growth through making people aware that every person is uniquely different and we shouldnt expect others to:
1. Think what we think
2. Feel what we feel
3. See what we see
4  Recognize what we recognize
5. Make decisions the way we make decisions
6. Want to spend time alone or with other people the way we do

Once we recognize that people are litterally at their core different from us, then there is alot of growth to be had. What inights are there to be made who knows? But I want to help facilitate those convos.
