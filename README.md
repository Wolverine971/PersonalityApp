# PersonalityApp

This the goal of this project is to use personality data to increase awareness and self-improvement of individuals. 
Ultimately I want to foster community growth through making people aware that every person is uniquely different and we shouldnt expect others to:
1. Think what we think
2. Feel what we feel
3. See what we see
4.  Recognize what we recognize
5. Make decisions the way we make decisions
6. Want to spend time alone or with other people the way we do

Once we recognize that people are litterally at their core different from us, then there is alot of growth to be had. What inights are there to be made who knows? But I want to help facilitate those convos.

We never want to sell the data but we do want to give it back to people with insights.
So the work to be done needs be be broad reaching-
I need to clean up the UI and get the routing more fluid and intuitive however there isnt much worth navigating to at the moment.
Right now the biggest problem I am working on is how to index one word answers so I can search through them and draw similarities between people.
Example:
Question: What problem do you want to solve?
User1: Love
User2: Peace
Both answers are global in nature and suggest big thinking, so I want to be able to Id that commonality and make some kind of relationship structure to store. The scope of the question is to broad so to draw better directed answers I could have a drop down of some predefined answers that they choose.
This is opposed to 2 users who answer, Homework, and Singleness. Where there is likely no commonality or similarity to draw upon.

So I need to index these answers and get some kind of data structure going. Having just talked this out I think the drop downs are probably the best.
